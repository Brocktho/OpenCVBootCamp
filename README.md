# OpenCVBootCamp
Some tests I was doing to learn OpenCV for python. A lot of the "scripts" are showcasing different pieces of the OpenCV toolbox.
After learning the tools available I used it in combinations with mss to create a fairly performant app that screen caps and allows you
to save the last few minutes of your screen. Need to update a path to save the video to in it's current form (V 0.1 beta...) 
<br>
To see the app in play, take a look at videoCapScripts
<br>
Future plans:
<br>
1. Make it so no arguments are required simply drag and drop the repo and press play and it saves video to desktop. (V 0.2)
2. Allow you to target a specific window, window must be visible on screen. (V 0.3)
3. Target specific window not requiring window to be visible but instead just grabbing what data should be passed to the screen if it were visible. (V 0.4)
4. Make paint functionality more performant so it's actually useable, perhaps just separate it into a secondary suite (V 1.0)
